            <p id="parabout_first"> Tealicious was founded in 1999 with the promise of delivering specialty teas from around the world. The company began in a spare room in the heart of Berlin, starting with nothing but a special tea brought back from Corsica. Initially, it was sold only to neighbours and acquaintances of the owners. However, from the earnings of that first batch, a company was born. </p>
            <br>
            <p> After the first Corsican tea, many others followed. The owners brought back a special tea each time they travelled, and over time, the small business flourished into a legend.</p>

            <img id="teahouse" src="images/teehouse.jpg" alt="original teahouse">
            <p> In 2003, the first official tea house was opened under the business name 'Tealicious,' marking the beginning of many successful years to come. </p>
            <br>
            <p> As of now, the company imports tea from over 100 countries, offering delicacies to customers in Germany, Switzerland, Spain, England, and France. </p>
            <br>
            <p> With the current goal of expanding internationally, the sky is the limit for the company—at least for now… </p>
